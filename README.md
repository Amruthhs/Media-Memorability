# Media-Memorability
From MediaEval’s webpage:
“This task focuses on the problem of predicting how memorable a video is to viewers. It
requires participants to automatically predict memorability scores for videos that reflect
the probability a video will be remembered. Task participants are provided with an
extensive dataset of videos that are accompanied by memorability annotations, as well as
pre-extracted state-of-the-art visual features. The ground truth has been collected
through recognition tests, and thus results from objective measurement of memory
performance. Participants will be required to train computational models capable of
inferring video memorability from visual content. Optionally, descriptive titles attached to
the videos may be used. Models will be evaluated through standard evaluation metrics
used in ranking tasks (Spearman’s rank correlation).”
